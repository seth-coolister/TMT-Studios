        <div class="review">"fun game, great concepts, there are a limited number of characters, you pick one to start your journey and get 2 random others join you in the first area, good variety of skills to unlock andupgarde, the relic items acquierd can also determine your play-style. i have played at some of the higher difficulties to extend play-ability but still worth the purchase price!"</div>

        <div class="review">"If this game was a free download it would still be too expensive. The menus and interfaces had the smooth refined nature of a 2002 flash game. combat animations either don’t exist or look like they came from a flipbook, and the sprites are either free license crap or placeholders that aren’t even cropped right. It would be worth something if the game brought something new to the table as far as mechanics or concepts, but it doesn’t even do that."</div>

        <div class="review">"A variety of baubles and character combinations gives the game tons of replay value and keeps the game fresh <br> <br> 10/10 would get my hand bit in a hole in the wall during a mystery event again"</div>
